# Trying the example

This example requires a Pro subscription and a Pro NPM token.

If you've got the subscription you can login to https://fontawesome.com/account and find your "Package Manager Token"

Use that and replace `TOKEN` with the real deal and run:

```
FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=TOKEN npm install
```
